# ShowTime Experience

Okay! Now you're logged in, you're here and it's time to have fun.

This is how ShowTime looks:

![main-dark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b96bee5-296f-4ceb-ac4b-0100f065c9fa)

We can also touch the switch and turn to light mode:

![main-light](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb58b9b7-8ece-48a3-98c2-675ca1896a0e)

We can scroll downwards and to the sides on each category:

![scroll-main-light](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3dceba7-53be-400e-86f9-1c0fb67748db)

Now when entering a movie we can see the details and also recommendations according to other users:

![movie-and-recs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2edbc4d6-f919-48ce-a105-4b69c466b9e5)

Watching the movie horizontially:

![video-player-horizontial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1274cc15-654f-4257-9837-24edb66129c0)

Now we can see it was added to our watched movies:

![watched movies](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/300b7292-7565-41da-bd65-32a782592dd3)

If you're really cool - you're an admin and then you get to do allll of the fun stuff. 
This is how you get to the management page:

![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d526499d-9c20-4174-9785-6e7603c5d0b8)

Now the Admin Panel is open for you to choose from. First, you'd want to add a movie - you'll get this page:

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/372716f7-ae9d-437a-952e-1cee4c23e077)

By clicking "Edit Movie", the app will redirect you to this page:

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2855e59e-4354-448f-99bb-311d31b366da)

You'll fill out all of the dry details:

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1c89956-e1ef-4183-a547-47a292e7dc0a)

Then you'll choose a preview image for the movie - you'll have options to choose from your gallery/files, and once you've chosen:

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af324bb8-9ee9-4197-9943-921de3cce9ed)

Then you'll choose again - now the actual movie file:

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee78fc77-c177-4155-8280-b64ba7bebb39)

And... your movie is ready to watch on the main screen!

![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a80ca79-0db5-4f1a-ab44-e2fb12af7373)

By clicking "Edit Movie", you'll be greeted with a scrollable (vertically) list of all of the movies that are currently in the system:

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcd1b207-5f90-401d-b2dd-aec71f4e59da)

You'll choose one - let's say "Harry Potter" - and you fill out the details again - you can write some of the same details, or change completely, choose different preview pictures and files:

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edd68d7-28fe-46fe-a1a9-c04bbdfd7d5f)

And you can see the change in the list (or just go back to the home screen and see it there):

![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80999809-a9c6-4ce6-ae91-e9d51f1a3a9d)

Upon clicking the "Delete Movie" button, you'll again get the movie list in the same way as in the editing option, but this time when you click on a movie that you want to delete, you'll be greeted with a dialog:

![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34503695-2397-457b-b44c-f14c575e7963)

You can choose to delete, and then the movie will be gone, or you can cancel and nothing will happen.
If you click on the "Add Category" button, you'll get this:

![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47107535-741a-440d-804c-bd308c84f77b)

You'll fill out the new category details, and then you'll have a new category (which will show on the main screen only once there are movies in it):

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd176fd7-17a4-4be4-a467-581dc8030359)

Now you want to edit a category - you'll get a list similar to the movie list, but with the category names:

![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e33ef48b-c784-487e-acb4-4a190e1906db)

You'll choose a category you want to edit - its current details will be shown:

![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b74417b1-826c-4320-9c6f-cb11228f3707)

You'll change it to whatever you want - let's say you'll call it "Good Laughs" - and there it is on the screen:

![16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fd24783-31d7-4f75-bc6a-2544b32a86c3)

Now when you want to delete a category, you'll be presented with the category list, you'll choose one in a similar way and will get this dialog:

![18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36550bd9-263d-4fcd-b95a-95563ebf01bd)

Now you'll want to search for a movie your friend recommended to you. But you don't remember how it's called, only that it has an "a" in its name. So you head over to the search bar and type "a":

![19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c7eafa-2aea-46e5-b80a-737e7ccb9555)

And you'll get all of the movies whose name contains an "a":

![20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ce5cb6b-54d8-47ec-a774-87dcff9cb756)

Now that you found your movie, you click on it and you can watch it and have a ball:
