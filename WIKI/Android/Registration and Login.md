# Welcome To ShowTime

When first launching our app, this is what you'll see:

![welcome_android](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3713e21-5256-4242-abd9-2eae3ed20b41)

# Registration

This is the registration screen:

![registration_android](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb0feb6-29e6-4cf4-89f3-83546d96426d)

The user is required to fill his details, according to requirements of 8+ passoword (letters and digits),
and also a vaild email with '@':

![invalid password](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bd707c4-1162-46e9-bb2c-9a76a111cdcd)

![invalidmail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75e81aea-5b93-44ac-b632-49b1bc5efabb)

Succesful Registration:

# Login

This is the login screen:

![login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb895711-f4f8-4c0d-9ea6-2a958d82b51a)

When entering wrong details we get this:

![bad_login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c58dd42f-21a1-4414-9a5f-ee3814072dc9)

When entering a correct username and password we reach the main app screen straight away (it was too quick to take a screenshot), which will be discussed in the corresponding file.
