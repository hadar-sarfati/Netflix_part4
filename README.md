# Netflix_part4

# Important, please note!

During the development of the Android application, we conducted the entire process in a separate repository. The repository link is provided here: https://github.com/hadar-sarfati/Netflix_android, where all the relevant code can be found.

We chose to keep it this way so that our progress throughout the work can be seen through push and pull requests.

Please make sure to start the server first, then you can run the code on an emulator and experience the application!
